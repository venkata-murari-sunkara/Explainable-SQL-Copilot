## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/venkata-murari-sunkara/explainable-sql-copilot.git
cd explainable-sql-copilot
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Mac/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```text
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/sqlcopilot
```

### 5. Run Backend

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

Backend URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### 6. Run Frontend

```bash
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

Frontend URL: `http://localhost:8501`

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. Upload Dataset

Upload a CSV file through the Streamlit interface. The application:
* Infers column types automatically (integer, float, text, date)
* Creates a PostgreSQL table dynamically
* Loads the CSV data into the table
* Discovers the schema for query generation

### 2. Ask a Question in Plain English

Example:

```text
What is the highest vehicle price?
```

Generated SQL:

```sql
SELECT MAX(vehicle_price) AS highest_vehicle_price
FROM product_t_csv;
```

### 3. Review the Plain-English Explanation

Before execution, the application explains what the SQL will do in simple terms — no SQL knowledge required to understand the result.

### 4. Approve and Execute

After reviewing the explanation and generated SQL, the user approves execution. The query runs against PostgreSQL in read-only mode and results are displayed as a table.

### 5. Visualize Results

For analytical queries, the application automatically generates charts. Example:

```text
Show average vehicle price by vehicle maker
```

Generates a bar chart with Plotly — no additional configuration needed.

## 🔒 Security Features

Only `SELECT` statements are permitted. The validator explicitly blocks:

* `DROP`
* `DELETE`
* `UPDATE`
* `INSERT`
* `ALTER`
* `TRUNCATE`

Queries referencing columns that do not exist in the actual PostgreSQL schema are also rejected — preventing LLM hallucinations from reaching the database.

---

## 🧠 Engineering Decisions & Tradeoffs

* **Two-layer SQL validation:** Rule-based blocking of destructive operations combined with schema validation against live PostgreSQL metadata. Application-level checks alone are insufficient — both layers working together provide defense in depth against unsafe LLM-generated queries.
* **Human-in-the-loop approval:** Users see the generated SQL and its plain-English explanation before execution — a deliberate design decision that builds trust and catches errors before they reach the database. Prioritizes transparency over speed.
* **Schema-aware prompting:** Live table and column metadata is injected into the Gemini prompt at query time. This prevents hallucinated column names and significantly improves SQL accuracy compared to static prompting.
* **Gemini Flash over GPT-4:** Chose Gemini 2.5 Flash for SQL generation — faster response times and lower cost per query than GPT-4o-mini, with comparable accuracy for structured NL2SQL tasks. Demonstrates provider-agnostic architecture across the portfolio.
* **Read-only PostgreSQL connection:** The query executor connects with read-only database permissions at the infrastructure level — not just application-level checks. Multiple layers of protection against accidental or malicious data modification.

---

## 🚧 Challenges Solved

* **Dynamic schema inference:** Automatically detecting PostgreSQL column types from CSV data without manual annotation — required handling mixed-type columns, empty values, and ambiguous formats (e.g., dates stored as strings).
* **Schema-aware prompting:** Injecting live table and column metadata into the Gemini prompt at query time to prevent hallucinated column names — significantly improved SQL accuracy on real-world datasets.
* **LLM output parsing:** Gemini occasionally returns SQL wrapped in markdown code fences or with explanatory text. Built a cleaning and extraction layer to strip formatting before validation and execution — ensuring consistent, parseable output.
* **Type mismatch handling:** CSV columns with mixed types (e.g., numeric values with occasional string entries) required preprocessing logic to coerce types safely before PostgreSQL insertion.
